        <p className="content">Progvinsâ€™ in-house developments help us in formulating not just our own chemical
            compounds, but also establish the most appropriate plating process sequences to match client needs.
             Before undertaking any job we evaluate and optimize in our pilot plant, all process sequences and 
            parameters, in order to fine-tune the overall processes and method.
            Drawing on its vast industrial experience and continual research, Progvins specializes in plating on 
            difficult- to- plate substrates. We specialize in large scale plating on difficult- to- plate substrates.
            Progvins designs its plants for each customer with economies of scale in mind. This means we have dormant capacity in our plant infrastructure, which helps us quickly scale in proportion to the demand.
